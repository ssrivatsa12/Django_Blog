# Django_Blog
A Blog created using Django Rest Framework and other front-end tools

In this Project I created a Blog using the below Tools

1)Django [Backend]
2)Django Rest Framework [Web Apis]
3)HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4, JavaScript [Front-end]


-> "mysite" is a project for this Blog
-> "api" is an app used for creating web apis of this Blog
-> "blog" is an app for creating Blog
-> "registration" is an app for SignUp and Login


Speciality:
  The speciality of this blog is, Whenever we create a new post the page is not reloaded because of using AJAX. For the Front page I'm retrieving the data from the API.
